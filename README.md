## Project Description

I used to love competing, especially in the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI). When the next edition was approaching, I was thinking about what new project to work on. I couldn't come up with an idea, and then my supervisor gave me a great one: to create a website where people could book tickets for museums.

I started looking to see if there was something like this already, but I couldn't find anything similar. What really got me excited was the idea itself. It aimed to show museums as something fresh and interesting, not old-fashioned places. I was thrilled because this project could make it easier for people to visit museums and, in doing so, share the beautiful history that our nation has.

And that's how Museum Booking was born. We want to change the way people see museums and make it easier for everyone to visit them. We also want to celebrate and share the rich history of our country.

It all began with a love for competition, but now it's about making culture and history accessible to everyone.
